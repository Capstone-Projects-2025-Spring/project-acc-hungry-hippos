</a>

The project's frontend testing is built on a foundation of Vitest, chosen for its seamless integration with the Vite development environment, along with the React Testing Library (RTL).
This combination was selected for its high performance and robust built-in mocking capabilities. RTL focuses on testing components from the user's perspective by interacting with the rendered output rather than internal implementation details.
The setup is configured to automatically generate code coverage reports, providing a clear measure of test effectiveness.

* **Test Case:**
    - **Precondition:** `foodKeys = ['apple']`
    - **Mocked:** `Phaser.Utils.Array.GetRandom`, `foods.create`
    - **Expected Result:** `foods.create()` called with valid food key and lane

---

### Method: `handleFoodCollision(hippoObj, foodObj)`

* **Purpose:** Removes food when it overlaps with the hippo.
* **Test Case:**

# Hippo Class (game Character)

- **Test Case 1: Initialization State**
  -Initialization with Scene and Physics: 
    - Input: scene, x, y, texture, moveStrategy
    - Procedure:
      - 1. Create a mock Phaser.scene and a mock MoveStrategy
      - 2. Instantiate a Hippo object
      - 3. Call isMouthOpen()
    - Expected Output: true

- **Test Case 2: Toggle Mouth State**
  - Objective: Verify that toggleMouth() flips the mouth state and updates the frame 
  - Input: N/A
  - Procedure:
    - 1. Call toggleMouth() once 
    - 2. Check isMouthOpen() -> should be false
    - 3. Call toggleMouth() again
    - 4. Check isMouthOpen() -> should be true
  - Expected Output: Mouth state alternates with each call 

- **Test Case 3: Movement Delegation**
  - Objective: Confirm update() delegates to the assigned move strategy
  -Input: Phaser.Types.Input.Keyboard.Cursorkeys object (mocked)
  -Procedure:
    - 1. Spy on the update() method of the mock strategy 
    - 2. Call hippo.update(mockCursorKeys)
  - Expected Output: moveStrategy.update() is called with hippo and mockCursorKeys

- **Test Case 4: Change Strategy at Runtime**
  - Objective: Ensure setStrategy() properly replaces the movement strategy
  - Input: New MoveStrategy instance
  - Procedure: 
    - 1. Create a second mock MoveStrategy 
    - 2. Set the new Strategy using setStrategy()
    - 3. Call update() with a mock cursor input 
  -Expected Output: The new strategy's update() method is called and not the old one
